This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Tyler and I'm setting this up for my intro to computer science class. I'm currently working towards a bachelors in computer science. I think my interest lies heavily in cyber security but there are a few avenues that peak my interest in computer science. I've always had an interest in computers but never thought I'd persue it. Nonetheless here we are!
